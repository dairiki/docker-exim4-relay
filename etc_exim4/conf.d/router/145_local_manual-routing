# router/145_local_manual_routes
#################################

# route specific domains manually.
#
# This works just like the hubbed_hosts, except that authentication
# will be attempted when passing on mail to the next server for mail
# routed here.  (Mail routed by hubbed_hosts gets delivered by the
# remote_smtp transport.  Mail routed by this router gets delivered
# by the remote_smtp_smarthost transport.)
#
# To actually authenticate, you will likely want to enter credentials
# in the passwd.client file.
#
# See exim4-config_files(5) and spec.txt chapter 20.3 through 20.7 for
# more detailed documentation on the hubbed_hosts router and the
# passwd.client file.
